# AI For Marketing

Repository of example applications for teaching AI in marketing practice and research.

## Overview

This repository contains two marketing applications that demonstrate practical applications of AI and generative AI in marketing:

### 1. AI for Image Classification

Image classification is the task of assigning a label or category to an image based on its visual content. It involves analyzing visual elements such as objects, people, scenes, colors, compositions, and emotional cues to automatically categorize images into predefined classes. 

In the digital age, organizations generate enormous volumes of visual content daily—from advertising campaigns to social media content to customer-generated images. Manual classification of such large-scale image datasets is time-consuming and costly. AI-powered image classification automates this process, enabling organizations to understand and leverage visual content at scale (see "Vision Transformers and Vision Language Models for Marketing: A Comparison of Paradigms for Image Classification," https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijresmar.2026.01.001)

A comprehensive application for image classification featuring:
- **Two Datasets**: Multiple datasets for training and evaluation
- **Vision Transformers**: Scripts and notebooks for implementing state-of-the-art vision transformer models
- **Vision Language Models**: Tools for leveraging multimodal models that combine vision and language understanding

### 2. GenAI for Influencer Marketing

Influencer marketing has become a cornerstone of digital marketing strategy. Brands invest heavily in sponsoring influencers to create visual content that reaches engaged audiences. However, this partnership model creates a fundamental tension:

Generative AI (GenAI) offers a new paradigm for resolving this tension. Visual generative AI models can create synthetic images trained on multiple sources of visual content simultaneously.

- The code contains example images and code for image captioning to create prompt ideas
- Images can be created using Googles Gemini (Nano Banana)

## Execution Environment

All notebooks and scripts can be executed in two ways:

1. **Google Colab**: Run the notebooks directly in your browser without any local setup requirements
2. **Local Python Installation**: Run the code on your local machine with a Python environment and required dependencies

Choose the environment that best suits your workflow and available resources.
